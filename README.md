## Project Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** to predict equipment failures before they happen.  

I developed a full end-to-end pipeline:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering & class balancing  
- Model comparison between classical ML and DNN  
- Model interpretability using feature importance  
- Interactive web app using **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** for real-time predictions.

‚úÖ **Goal**: Help manufacturing teams schedule preventive maintenance and avoid unplanned downtime.

## Business Problem
Unplanned equipment failures lead to:
- Production downtime  
- High repair & replacement costs  
- Worker safety risks  

With a reliable **failure prediction system**, companies can:
- Detect issues early  
- Schedule maintenance efficiently  
- Save operational costs  
- Improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (UCI ML Repository)  
- **Size**: ~10,000 records  
- **Features**: torque, temperature, rotational speed, tool wear, machine type, etc.  
- **Target**: `Machine failure` (binary classification)

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Dropped non-predictive IDs  
- Encoded categorical variable (`Type`)  
- Standardized continuous features with `StandardScaler`  
- Fixed class imbalance using **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}**  
- Engineered `Temp Diff` (Process ‚àí Air temperature)

## Modeling
I trained and compared several ML models along with a DNN baseline:

| Model                  | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.82     | 0.82     |
| Random Forest            | 0.99     | 0.99     |
| XGBoost                  | 0.99     | 0.99     |
| KNN                      | 0.96     | 0.96     |
| SVM                      | 0.95     | 0.95     |
| **DNN (Keras)**          | **0.96** | **0.96** |

üü¢ **Best performer**: Tree-based models (Random Forest & XGBoost)  
‚ö° DNN also showed competitive performance.

## Results
- Very high classification accuracy  
- **Low false negatives** ‚Äî critical for safety  
- Confusion matrix confirmed strong predictive performance  
- Consistent results after cross-validation

---

## Interpretability
- Feature importance analysis showed:
  - **Torque** and **Tool wear** were strong failure indicators  
- Training curves (DNN) confirmed good convergence without overfitting

---

## Streamlit App
An interactive web application built with **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}**.
